###  THIS IS SImple but unique/fun application of cv2 ##

as name suggests it can see through red colour objects

What this does is records an image at beginning of program
converts it to Numpy Array ---> Flips It --- Converts back to Image -- Displays

## Not my original idea but still I modified it to do it with different colours- Yellow


Requirements:
cv2
numpy
Laptop Camera
python
